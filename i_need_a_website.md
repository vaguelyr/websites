This is repo for notes on making websites. Specifically websites to display a handful of markdown files for the lowest cost. 
It's also a proof of concept site. 

## I just need a website!
### Option 1: free and lowest effort
Just put your markdown files in github and use linktree and docsify-this.net to display them. 
You're not running a business, you're sharing text (images are supported too:))

Pro: 
- Extremely easy to start and use
- Free

Cons: 
- Not super professional but that might be ok


### Option 2: I do it for you
I can do it for you. $5 per month and you pay for the domain name. porkbun is good for buying a domain name. I could be persuaded to buy a domain name and use it to host multiple sites. 
We get an actual linux server and can modify everything. 

## Let's run a business!
Contact me. :)
